"This is my first project in TOP - Simple recipe site using basic HTML" 

    Website contains three recipes that is easy and quick to dish up. 
    I've tried to use as many HTML elements I've learnt so far on this project. 

** Update 12/1/24 **
Added style element to the website as external stylesheet under static folder.

(Total time spent on the project - 2 hours)

Thanks for looking.
